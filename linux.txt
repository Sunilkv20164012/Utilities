Check your /etc/apt/apt.conf

Network -Network Proxy GUI will update /etc/apt/apt.conf and set the proxy info there.
Find out the proxy server info from pac

You can find the details by reading the proxy.pac file anyway.

So the /etc/apt/apt.conf should look like below (suppose the proxy server is => proxy.company.com port 80), do NOT use pac URL.

Acquire::http::proxy "http://proxy.company.com:80/";
Acquire::https::proxy "https://proxy.company.com:80/";
Acquire::ftp::proxy "ftp://proxy.company.com:80/";
